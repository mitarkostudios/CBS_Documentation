<h1> Tournament Module </h1>

This module allows you to introduce tournaments into the game for the participation of players. Tournaments are presented in the form of leagues. The player starts from the first league and, depending on the results, moves to the next one.

The following settings are available in the editor.

First, you need to create several leagues. For example bronze, silver and gold. Click on "Add new tournament" to do this.

Now you need to configure each league separately.

**Tournament Name - **Display name of the league.

**Is Default Tournament ? - **New players will start the default tournament. At least one tournament must be in default state.

**Duration - **Determines how long the tournament will run. This option is common for all tournaments.

**Next Tournament - **Determine which next tournament the player will get to if he takes a high place in the rating.

**Downgrade Tournament - **Determine which next tournament the player will get to if he takes a low place in the rating.

Now you can adjust the number of participants. Click "Add new position" to add a new position for the participant. The maximum value is 100

Now determine from what place in the tournament the players will get to the next league and from what place they will go to the previous one. If the place is not indicated - the player will remain in the same league
